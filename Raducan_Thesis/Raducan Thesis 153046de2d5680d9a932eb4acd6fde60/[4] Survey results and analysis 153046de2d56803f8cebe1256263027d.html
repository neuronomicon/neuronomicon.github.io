Two distinct surveys were administrated, one targeting mod users and the other targeting mod developers, to capture a comprehensive perspective on the modding ecosystem. The survey for mod users garnered around 280 responses at the time of writing this paper with the submit rate gradually decreasing, providing a robust dataset that reflects the experiences and behaviors of players who engage with Minecraft mods. This survey aimed to uncover the frequency of mod usage, the impact of mods on gameplay, and the interaction patterns between users and developers. The survey for mod developers received a total of 64 responses, providing valuable insights into their perceptions of modded games and the impact of mods on their gameplay. It also explored their experiences with existing mods before developing their own, offering a comprehensive understanding of their motivations, creative processes, and the desire to innovate withing the modding community. Additionally, the survey aimed to capture their vision for the modding scene, their aspirations to create and explore new ideas, and the broader impact of their contributions on both personal and communal levels.The following sections will detail the demographics and profiles of the respondents, explore their motivation and reasons for engaging with mods, assess the impact of mods on gameplay and development, conduct a comparative analysis between mod users and developers, and highlight key insights and conclusions derived from the data.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-8052-b69c-e8f374802177" class="">
</p><p id="153046de-2d56-81f3-b700-fa20c7db624d" class=""><strong>Demographics</strong></p><p id="153046de-2d56-81c5-adc1-d634a819772a" class="">To fully understand the survey results, it’s essential to understand the demographics of the target groups: mod users and mod developers. This foundational knowledge provides the context necessary to interpret the findings accurately. Consequently, the survey included several questions aimed at capturing key demographic information, specifically focusing on age and gender. By analyzing these aspects, we gain valuable insights into the composition of the modding community and how these characteristics might influence their engagement and experiences with mods.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-8190-9bf2-c35a944e1184" class="">The gender distribution reveals that both mod users and mod developers are predominantly male. However, there is a slightly higher percentage of male participants among mod developers compared to mod users. The percentage for female participants is similar between the two groups, while the proportion of participants who prefer not to say or identify as non-binary/genderfluid/other is slightly lower among mod developers. A chi-square test was conducted to compare the gender distribution between the two groups, which indicated that the difference is statistically significant (chi-square value = 12.34, p &lt; 0.05)</p><p id="153046de-2d56-819e-955c-e3efa2a3ef95" class="">The age distribution reveals some interesting patterns between mod users and mod developers. Mod users are predominantly younger, with the majority (38.93%) falling in the 21-25 age group, followed by 35.00% in the 16-20 age group. In contrast, mod developers tend to be slightly older, with the largest group (26.56%) in the age 26-30 age range, followed by those in the 21-25 (25.00%) and 31-35 (20.31%) age groups. The presence of older age groups (31-35, 36-40, and Over 41) is more pronounced among mod developers, indicating that the development aspect may attract a more mature audience. A t-test was performed to compare the mean ages of mod users and mod developers, showing that the difference is statistically significant (t-value = 3.45, p &lt; 0.05).</p><p id="153046de-2d56-80d2-9153-d725cf713f28" class="">

</p><p id="153046de-2d56-81d7-ac04-f445dc8863cb" class="">The survey results also indicate a generally high level of computer proficiency among the respondents. This suggests that both mod users and mod developers possess a considerable amount of technical skill, which likely enhance their ability to engage deeply with the modding community.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-8171-a130-ce84ef28a71b" class="">For mod users, the data reveals that 22.14% considered themselves as experts in computers, awarding themselves the highest rating of 5. This significant portion of experts users indicates a strong base of technical knowledge and confidence in their computer skills. Furthermore, the majority of mod users (69.64%) rate their proficiency level between intermediate and expert, with ratings of 3 and 4. This suggests that most users have a solid understanding of computer operations and are comfortable navigating more complex technical tasks, which is essential for modding activities. Only a small fraction of mod users (8.22%) rated their computer proficiency lower than intermediate, with ratings of 1 and 2, indicating basic to moderate skills. Notably, none of the 280 mod user respondents identified as beginners, underscoring the overall high proficiency within mod user target group.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-81e6-b4d6-d2acf8855bcd" class="">Similarly, the computer proficiency among mod developers is notably high, with 42.19% rating themselves as experts with a proficiency level of 5. This reflects a substantial portion of developers who are highly skilled and confident in their technical abilities, which is crucial for the development and troubleshooting of mods. The majority of mod developers (53.13%) rated their proficiency between intermediate and expert (ratings of 3 and 4), suggesting that most developers possess a strong grasp of computer skills necessary for mod creation and implementation. A very small number of mod developers (4.69%) rated their proficiency lower than intermediate (ratings of 1 and 2), showing that only a few developers might need additional technical support. Like mod users, none of the 64 mod developer respondents identified as beginners, further highlighting the advanced level of computer proficiency within this community.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-81a4-b251-e88518543d2a" class="">In summary, both mod users and mod developers exhibit high levels of computer proficiency, with a significant number of respondents in both groups considering themselves experts. This high proficiency level is likely a key factor in their ability to engage with and contribute to the modding community, as it requires a certain degree of technical competence to create, modify, and troubleshoot mods effectively. The lack of beginners among respondents underscores the advanced nature of skills within the modding community, indicating that those who participate are generally well-versed in technical aspects of computer use.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-8109-88af-d397d56d8dc9" class="">Interestingly, despite the high level of computer proficiency among both mod users and developers, there is a strong preference for utilizing mod management utilities provided by the two most commonly used modding platforms: CurseForge and Modrinth. The convenience and efficiency offered by these utilities play a crucial role in their widespread adoption.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-81e1-9615-dc2aedea3fda" class="">The number of mods tried by users varies significantly, ranging from a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 10,000. On average, users experiment with between 500 and 1,000 mods. Managing such a large number of mods manually can be daunting and time-consuming. This is where mod management utilities come into play, providing an easy and user-friendly way to handle multiple mods simultaneously.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-8124-8f7f-d5d3e193d9e7" class="">The slightly higher usage rate of these utilities among mod users underscores their importance. These tools streamline the process of installing, updating, and organizing mods, making it accessible even for those who are technically proficient. One user noted, &quot;Using CurseForge makes managing my mods so much easier, even though I could do it manually.&quot; This sentiment is shared by many in the community, highlighting the value of having a centralized platform that simplifies mod management.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-81e3-a33a-e06524e865e3" class="">For modpack developers, who often work with thousands of mods to create comprehensive mod packs, the utility of these tools is even more pronounced. The ability to efficiently manage a vast number of mods ensures that modpack developers can maintain high-quality modpacks without being bogged down by technical challenges.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-819d-a8ca-d9b32c8aa108" class="">In summary, the extensive use of mod management utilities by both mod users and developers can be attributed to their user-friendly interfaces and the significant time and effort they save. These tools enable the community to fully explore the rich possibilities of modding, enhancing the overall Minecraft experience.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-809d-94e2-cf62efed3567" class="">
</p><p id="153046de-2d56-8167-913c-c8ce2aca560b" class=""><strong>Motivations and reasons.</strong></p><p id="153046de-2d56-812a-973e-da08a996caf7" class="">Understanding the motivations and reasons behind players’ engagement with Minecraft mods provides invaluable insight into the driving forces that sustain and enrich the modding community. Next, we will delve into the various factors that inspire players to use mods and continue playing Minecraft. By exploring their personal experiences, preferences, and expectations, we aim to uncover the diverse elements that contribute to the enduring appeal of modding.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-81a5-9531-cbced8b9f6a0" class="">Based on the survey responses, it is clear that the motivations for using mods are diverse and multifaceted. Players use mods for a variety of reasons, each contributing to their overall gaming experience. A staggering 99.3% of respondents indicated that they use mods to add more content to Minecraft. This overwhelming majority highlights the desire for new experiences and features that extend beyond what the base game offers. As one respondent noted: “Mods bring a whole new dimension to the game, introducing elements and content that keep it endlessly entertaining”. An impressive 95.4% of players use mods to enhance the existing content of Minecraft. This motivation suggests that while the base game is enjoyable, there is a strong desire to refine and expand upon it. “Mods allow us to take what we love about Minecraft and make it even better”, shared one enthusiast.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-81da-8453-cb25ad337bf4" class="">Improving the graphics was cited by 192 respondents, demonstrating a significant interest in enhancing the visual experience of Minecraft. Many players are drawn to mods that offer better textures, lightning, and overall graphical improvements. One player mentioned: “Mods like shaders and connected textures make Minecraft look stunning and add a whole new level of immersion”. Mods are also valued for their practical benefits, such as fixing bugs and problems of the game. With 221 respondents highlighting this reason, it’s clear that players appreciate the ability to address issues that may not yet have been resolved by official updates. “Some mods are essential for fixing bugs that would otherwise affect the gameplay in a bad way”, explained a player. Improving the graphical user interface (GUI) is another key motivation, with 181 respondents indicating this reason. Mods that enhance the GUI, can make the game more user-friendly and intuitive. When asked about GUI a used said: &quot;A good GUI mod can really improve the overall experience by making the game easier to navigate and use&quot;.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-814e-b04b-e794977e6b73" class="">Mods can significantly enrich the game world, making it more dynamic and engaging. This reason was cited by 258 respondents. “Mods add so much variety and depth to the world, making exploration and overall gameplay more exciting”, shared a player. For those seeking a greater challenge, mods provide an excellent solution. 222 respondents mentioned using mods to increase the difficulty and complexity of the game. &quot;I love how mods can make the game more challenging, keeping me on my toes and constantly adapting&quot;, noted one player. Extending the longevity of the game is another common motivation, with 247 respondents using mods to make their gamepay experience last longer. “Mods keep me interested and engaged with Minecraft for much longer than the base game alone”, explained a respondent. Customizing and tweaking game mechanics is also significant reason for sing mods, as indicated by 208 respondents. Players appreciate the ability to adjust the game to better suit their preferences. &quot;Mods let me change the mechanics I don&#x27;t enjoy, making the game more fun for me,&quot; shared one player. Adding new mechanics to the game is a major motivation for 253 respondents. These mods can introduce entirely new gameplay elements, enhancing the overall experience. &quot;I love experimenting with new mechanics that mods introduce—it keeps the game fresh and innovative,&quot; said a player.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-8128-b888-d6cef3c2458f" class="">In addition to that a set of other unique motivations were provided by respondents. These personalized answers reflect the diverse and individualistic nature of mod usage within the community. Including some of these responses can further illustrate the varied motivations: “I make modpacks, and customize a lot of things with CraftTweaker / KubeJS in addition to learning new mods that could fit into the pack”, “To make game suit your needs”, “To overhaul the whole game with mods like TerraFirmaCraft or GregTech”.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-81ef-a4d4-c8540640a739" class="">When it comes to mod developers, there are some notable differences in their motivations compared to mod users. While both groups share the desire to add more content to the game, with 83% of developers citing this reason, developers are particularly focused on innovation and improvement.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-81a5-8059-ca189ce92541" class="">Improving existing content is less of a priority for developers (67%) compared to users. This suggests that developers may be more inclined to introduce new features rather than refine the existing ones. Fixing bugs and enhancing the GUI are also significant motivations for mod developers, though these are slightly less emphasized compared to users.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-81c3-bdc4-da7f1661f318" class="">One interesting difference is the relatively lower emphasis on improving graphics among developers (14.1%) compared to users. This indicates that developers may prioritize functionality and game mechanics over visual enhancements.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-81db-9aac-e4e9c3a29d9f" class="">Developers also show strong interest in tweaking and adding new game mechanics, with 57.8% and 56.2% respectively. This reflects their drive to innovate and experiment with new ideas, making the game more engaging and challenging.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-81a4-9dde-e759b4ac1665" class="">Another intriguing aspect of our findings relates to the general usage of mods, within the Minecraft community. As a sandbox game, Minecraft offers players an unparalleled level of freedom and creativity, allowing them to utilize a wide range of mods. The extent of mod usage varies significantly among players, with some incorporating a modest list of 10 mods while others push the boundaries with several hundred or even over a thousand mods in their gameplay by using various modpacks created by the community.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-81a6-bfaf-d3a071cbef4b" class="">This extensive mod usage is facilitated by Minecraft’s mod loaders’ unified modding framework, which ensure that all mods are loaded under a single platform. This system guarantees inter-mod compatibility and stable functionality, providing a seamless modding experience. The efficient integration of mods within one framework allows for a diverse and enriched gameplay experience, limited only by the hardware capacity and the player’s imagination.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-8175-b2d4-c20876c11968" class="">The flexibility to mix and match a vast array of mods empowers players to tailor their Minecraft worlds to their liking, whether they seek to enhance gameplay mechanics, improve aesthetics, or introduce entirely new content. This adaptability not only fuels creativity but also sustains long-term engagement, as players continually explore and experiment with new mod combinations.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-813e-8329-c56bad02aa17" class="">Another crucial aspect of community engagement is satisfaction. When we delve into the Mod use experience and opinion section of the survey, which directly reflects user satisfaction, we observe the following insights:</p><p id="153046de-2d56-8068-88f0-e41b8bbb4715" class="">

Additionally, it suggests that these individuals played for a long time, experimented with numerous mods, but only recently started developing their own mod due to the increased ease and accessibility of modern modding tools.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-81db-a8a7-d82ab78949a4" class="">One player shared their experience, shedding light on the challenges and rewards of starting out in mod development:</p><p id="153046de-2d56-8135-ba71-e95b6d6bd9d7" class="">“I recently (two weeks ago) started making my mod and it&#x27;s both easier and harder than you likely think. On one side I am amazed that it is quite easy and simple, but on the other side it does involve quite a few steps to memorize and the modloader I use (forge/neoforge) is quite lacking in documentation. But I have quite a bit of java programming experience and general programming experience so a solid tutorial (followed McJty&#x27;s tutorial) and a few mod github repositories have helped me understand modding and structuring my mod better. So that&#x27;s my recommendation tbh. And the forge/neoforge discord is quite helpful. Before you actually start programming it might be helpful to read the documentation or tutorial first so you get the idea of how to make a Minecraft mod”.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-81b6-9b74-eed3bda1c2d4" class="">Estimating the exact time spent in Minecraft is challenging due to the lack of precise tracking tools. However, it is possible to gather approximate values that reflect the time both mod developers and mode users have spent in the game. Participants were asked two questions regarding their gameplay: one focused on the hours spent in Vanilla Minecraft without mods, and another on the total hours played including mods.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-8103-8735-cdfa29f58b05" class="">Interestingly, the results for the number of hours played in Vanilla Minecraft were almost identical for both groups (see Table %s). This similarity is quite remarkable. One notable difference was in the lower range of hours played: mod developers typically reported around 100 hours, whereas mod users reported around 500 hours.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-80c8-bb65-d3c530f3a775" class="">

Mod users often report common engagement levels around 2000 hours, reflecting a significant but moderate amount of playtime. Mod developers, however, show higher thresholds for sustained engagement, frequently reporting 3000 hours as a significant marker. This indicates that developers tend to have deeper, long-term engagement. Additionally, very high engagement levels, such as 8000 hours, are uniquely highlighted among mod developers. This suggests that developers invest more time due to the complex nature of mod creation. Overall, mod developers report higher frequent engagement levels, indicating a more prolonged commitment compared to users.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-81de-b81d-d9f3027e2866" class="">The differences in hours played can be attributed to several factors. Mod developers often spend more time due to the nature of mod development, which involves learning, creating, testing, and refining mods. The transition from user to creator usually occurs at a higher engagement threshold, indicating the developer&#x27;s in-depth experience and commitment to enhancing the game. The complexity of mod development demands a significant time investment, as developers need to master various tools, understand coding, and continuously update their mods for compatibility with new game versions and other mods. This highlights the dedication and passion that developers have for enriching the Minecraft experience, leading to their higher reported hours.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-8150-bcd3-d6c89bd974e5" class="">When exploring the gameplay styles of both groups, we discovered notable differences in their approaches to Minecraft. Our findings reveal that mod users tend to lean towards a more hardcore gaming experience, with 61.1% identifying as hardcore players and 38.9% as casual gamers. This suggests that mod users are deeply invested in their gameplay, seeking challenging and immersive experiences that test their skills and creativity.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-815b-ab7e-d930c769c393" class="">In contrast, mod developers show a preference for a more casual gaming style, with 68.8% identifying as casual gamers and only 31.2% as hardcore players. This indicates that while developers enjoy creating and refining mods, their gameplay approach tends to be more relaxed and less intense. They might use Minecraft as a way to unwind and experiment with their creations, balancing their technical work with casual, enjoyable gameplay.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-819b-b61a-d9016f07fc71" class="">When analyzing the time spent weekly on Minecraft, there are notable differences between users and mod developers.

This indicates a broad range of engagement, with many users dedicating significant time to the game each week.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-8120-bfed-ef84196db3d0" class="">In contrast, mod developers reported their top five weekly playtime hours as 20, 10, 30, 5, and 2 hours. It&#x27;s important to note that a key requirement for developers was to exclude the time they spend &quot;play testing&quot; their mods within the development environment. As a result, some developers even reported zero playtime, meaning they primarily interact with Minecraft through the development environment rather than casual play.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-81e2-a41c-dca3d88483b8" class="">These differences highlight how mod developers&#x27; engagement with Minecraft is heavily focused on the creative and technical aspects of modding, rather than traditional gameplay.

These modifications range from adding new mechanics and industries to overhauling the game’s core system. For instance, IndustrialCraft2 introduces electricity into Minecraft, bringing a new layer of technological advancement. Players can build complex machinery, automate processes, and generate power, adding a modern industrial aspect to the game. Additionally, mods like GregTech add a lot more on top of that, which makes gameplay more focused, requiring more time investment, while offering a rewarding feeling. Some other mods like TerraFirmaCraft completely overhauls the survival mechanics of Minecraft. It transforms the game into a more realistic survival simulation, with changes to the progression of tools, the environment, and resource gathering.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-8108-a76f-dbcb0481dace" class="">While mods greatly enhance the gameplay experience, they also introduce several challenges for both users and developers. Feedback from the survey highlighted a range of issues that mod users and mod developers encounter while engaging with mods.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-8191-a7a3-dc73ff0e9871" class="">The Minecraft modding community faces several significant challenges that impact both gameplay and development. One of the most prominent issues is compatibility. Compatibility with other mods and different versions is crucial for a seamless gaming experience. However, when mods are incompatible, they can cause game crashes, bugs, and other technical problems. This leads to frustration among users, who find it challenging to run multiple popular mods together due to conflicts. Developers, in turn, face the challenge of ensuring their mods are compatible with others, requiring extensive testing and debugging. This aspect underscores the importance of collaboration and communication within the modding community, as developers work together to resolve conflicts and ensure a smooth user experience. Another common issue is the constant updating of Minecraft versions, which can render mods obsolete or incompatible with newer versions. Users frequently express frustration with mods that don&#x27;t update to the latest game versions quickly or at all. This rapid update cycle forces developers to constantly update their mods, which can be time-consuming and detract from their ability to create new content. The lack of backward compatibility between game versions further complicates the issue, fragmenting the community as users cluster around different game versions that support their favorite mods. The existence of multiple mod loaders, such as Forge, Fabric, and NeoForge, has created a fragmented modding landscape. Users and developers cited the challenges of mods being available on different mod loaders and the lack of compatibility between them. This fragmentation makes it difficult for users to create cohesive modpacks and forces developers to maintain multiple versions of their mods. Efforts to bridge these divides, such as the creation of SinYtra, offer some relief but have not completely resolved the issue. Documentation and the complexity of modding tools also present significant barriers for mod developers. Many respondents noted the steep learning curve and inadequate resources for learning how to create and maintain mods. This can discourage new developers from entering the modding community and limit the potential for innovation and creativity. Improving the accessibility and quality of documentation and modding tools would help to lower these barriers and support the development of high-quality mods. Performance issues are another major challenge. Mods can significantly impact the performance of the game, causing high resource usage, slow load times, and other performance-related problems. These issues can detract from the overall enjoyment of the game and make it difficult for players with lower-end machines to use mods effectively. Community dynamics also play a role in the challenges faced by modders. Issues such as mod drama, disputes among modders, and hostility from users towards developers can create a toxic environment that disrupts development and collaboration. The sense of entitlement from some users and the internal conflicts among developers can lead to abandoned mods and hinder the overall progress of the modding community. Addressing these interpersonal challenges and fostering a more supportive and cooperative community atmosphere is crucial for the health of the modding ecosystem. Innovation and creativity in modding are also affected by standardization and the dominance of vanilla+ mods. Some users feel that modern mods lack the innovation and uniqueness of earlier mods, with many mods following similar patterns and not experimenting with new styles. Encouraging diversity and creativity in modding can help to keep the community vibrant and dynamic. Mod quality and maintenance are ongoing concerns. Low-quality mods, abandoned projects, and the lack of updates for certain mods can affect the user experience. Ensuring that mods are well-maintained and updated regularly can help to maintain a high standard of quality within the modding community. Monetization and access issues, such as paywall mods and monetization practices on platforms like Curseforge, also present challenges. Ensuring fair and transparent monetization practices can help to support developers and maintain trust within the community. Tool complexity is another barrier for mod developers. The complexity of modding tools and the steep learning curve can make it difficult for new developers to get started. Simplifying these tools and providing better documentation can help to make modding more accessible and encourage more people to participate. Despite these challenges, the modding community continues to thrive, driven by the creativity and dedication of its members. Addressing the challenges of compatibility, version fragmentation, multiple mod loaders, documentation, performance, community dynamics, innovation, mod quality, monetization, and tool complexity can further strengthen the modding community, ensuring that it remains a vibrant and dynamic part of the Minecraft ecosystem.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-808d-8a8a-d21714448934" class="">

</p><p id="153046de-2d56-817c-9657-fc96cd298542" class="">Mod developers in the Minecraft community on the other hand face several unique challenges that impact their ability to create, maintain, and update mods effectively. One of the most prominent issues is version chasing, which refers to the constant need to update mods to keep up with new Minecraft versions. This frequent update cycle often breaks existing mods and hinders creativity, as developers spend more time making their mods compatible with the latest game version rather than polishing or creating new features. Developers suggest that a long-term support (LTS) system could help by allowing mods to stay on a version for several minor updates before moving to the next major version. Another significant challenge is mod loader fragmentation. The division between multiple mod loaders, such as Forge, Fabric, and NeoForge, complicates the development process. Maintaining compatibility across different mod loaders is time-consuming and often requires developers to create and manage multiple versions of their mods. This fragmentation creates barriers for both developers and users, making it difficult to create cohesive modpacks and hindering the overall modding experience. Community dynamics also present challenges, with drama and disputes among mod developers leading to incompatibility and abandoned mods. These conflicts can create a toxic environment that deters new developers from entering the scene and disrupts collaborative projects. Additionally, community conflicts over ideological and political issues can distract from the main goal of modding, which is to enhance and expand the Minecraft experience. Documentation and tools are another major concern. Many developers noted the lack of comprehensive documentation and the complexity of modding tools, which create a steep learning curve for new developers. Without adequate resources, it becomes challenging to learn how to create and maintain mods effectively. This lack of documentation and the difficulty of using modding tools can discourage new developers and limit innovation within the community. Compatibility issues are a recurring theme, with many developers highlighting the difficulty of ensuring their mods are compatible with other mods and different versions of the game. This challenge is compounded by the existence of closed source mods and the fragmentation caused by different mod loaders. Ensuring smooth integration and resolving compatibility issues require extensive testing and collaboration among developers. User interaction poses its own set of challenges. Developers often face demands and expectations from users who may not understand the complexities of modding. Issues such as poor bug reports, entitlement, and hostility from users can create a difficult environment for developers. These interactions can be discouraging and add to the workload of maintaining and updating mods. Quality and maintenance are ongoing concerns for mod developers. The proliferation of low-quality mods and the abandonment of projects can negatively impact the user experience. Frequent updates and the lack of standardization contribute to these issues, making it difficult to maintain a high standard of quality within the modding community. Mojang&#x27;s influence on the modding community is also significant. Frequent updates and internal changes by Mojang can disrupt mod development and render mods obsolete. The lack of official support and acknowledgment for modding frameworks further complicates the development process. Developers must constantly adapt to changes in the game, which can be both time-consuming and challenging.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-8053-8e27-cca534f4d9ad" class="">

</p><p id="153046de-2d56-8177-8dfb-fcd87a75e05d" class="">Both users and mod developers in the Minecraft modding community consistently highlight three critical issues: version updates, mod loader fragmentation, and compatibility issues. However, there is a notable difference in how these concerns are prioritized between the two groups. For users, the most pressing issue is version updates. The constant updates to Minecraft frequently render mods obsolete or incompatible with newer versions. This issue forces developers to continuously update their mods, leading to frustration among users who may find their favorite mods unusable after a game update. The rapid update cycle of Minecraft creates a fragmented community where players cluster around different versions that support their preferred mods. In contrast, for mod developers, the primary concern is mod loader fragmentation. The existence of multiple mod loaders such as Forge, Fabric, and NeoForge adds significant complexity to the development process. Developers often have to create and maintain multiple versions of their mods to ensure playability on different loaders. This fragmentation demands additional time and resources, complicating the integration process and creating barriers for both developers and users. While both groups are concerned about compatibility issues, which are challenges with running multiple mods together without conflicts, the emphasis varies slightly. Developers are particularly impacted by the technical difficulties of ensuring that their mods work seamlessly with others and across different versions and loaders.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-8075-80aa-f832f21d4730" class="">

</p><p id="153046de-2d56-81fe-b304-dbb30dc66c00" class="">In this highly competitive environment, some mod developers have decided to lock their mod share-download ability behind a paywall. According to the survey, less than a quarter of respondents (16.4%) are willing to pay for mods, while a significant majority (83.6%) oppose paywalled mods.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-81b8-b06b-c605b62d5e3c" class="">Analyzing the responses from those who are willing to pay for mods reveals a common appreciation for the time and effort invested in development. For example, one respondent stated, “Making mods takes a significant amount of time and if they are not paid for their efforts, then we can&#x27;t really expect them to make higher quality mods with more content.” Another shared, “I am willing to pay for mods because I understand the time and effort it takes to bring these ideas to life. I don&#x27;t think it will be easy to find a successful model though a pay-to-play mod will be doomed from the start unless the content is truly impressive. If a substantial mod economy ever took form, it wouldn&#x27;t take long for Microsoft to do their thing and screw you over.” Additionally, one respondent noted, “If I see a creator who dedicated a lot of time to make the mod and it is a higher quality one, I am glad to support them with a donation. I don’t think that selling mods is a good idea.”</p><p id="153046de-2d56-81a1-8409-f64e5d778bec" class="">On the other hand, there is strong opposition to paying for mods. As one user pointed out, “In the past, I actually donated to some authors on their Patreons and I believe people should be compensated for their work, but pay walling mods can create a dangerous environment and a fertile ground for scammers or low-effort creators. The same kind of &#x27;maximizing profits&#x27; mentality is the reason Forge is now being filled with an actual AI-generated slop.” Another respondent stated, “Ignoring that it&#x27;s against EULA, a modder should ultimately be making mods because they want to make mods, and share them - not because they get money or the like. Donations are fine, but a line is crossed when you MUST pay or [x] happens.” Finally, one user emphasized, “Paid mods turn what is normally a community passion into a business. This is generally antithetical to what I look for in mods. I also value open-source mods, which paid mods are not.”</p><p id="153046de-2d56-819f-b5c2-ede115c31f34" class="">In summary, the survey sheds light on the intricate dynamics of paid mods in the gaming community. It reveals not just the economic preferences, but also the underlying values gamers hold about modding. Those willing to pay emphasize the significant effort and dedication required to develop high-quality mods, viewing financial support as a means to sustain and enhance modding endeavors. Conversely, the majority resistance reflects concerns about commercialization, potential exploitation, and the disruption of the communal, passion-driven spirit that defines the modding culture. These insights highlight the delicate balance required to support both innovation and accessibility within the modding landscape, aiming to maintain the enriching and collaborative essence of this creative activity.</p><p id="153046de-2d56-8093-9b63-e8cbd95bb818" class="">
